# SpellBook
This is a old project of mine from when I was in college. It has a ton of old, not great code.

The idea behind it is an application that would allow me to do quick searches for different pathfinder spells.
It also has the ability to sort every pathfinder spell by School. Additionaly you can make personal spell books 
that contain only the spells you select.

I am working on refactoring a lot of this and will be porting it to an asp.net platform some time soon.
